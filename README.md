## ✨About Me ✨

- 🌱 I'm currently learning about programming for micro computers like the **ESP-32** and **Arduino** for small home projects. I enjoy the challenge and mixing physical hardware with software in unique ways to solve problems.

-  🏁My goals are to become proficient with many types of programming languages and architectures. I am always excited to tinker with new languages and I hope that I can improve my ability to read documentations better so I can learn even faster.
